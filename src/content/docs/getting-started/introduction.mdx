MonoDetour is a .NET detouring library powered by [MonoMod.RuntimeDetour](<https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod>). What this means is that MonoDetour can be used to [insert hooks before and after methods](/hooking/normal-methods), and [modify their CIL instructions](/ilhooking/introduction) at runtime.

MonoDetour is mainly designed to be used with HookGen. That is, MonoDetour generates helpers hooks to make hooking easy.

You can use the generated hooks like so:

```cs
// Generate helper hooks for the target type.
[MonoDetourTargets(typeof(SomeType))]
class SomeTypeHooks
{
    // MonoDetourManager.InvokeHookInitializers will
    // call methods marked with this attribute in types
    // which have the MonoDetourTargetsAttribute.
    [MonoDetourHookInitialize]
    internal static void InitHooks()
    {
        // Note: this is using the default generated MonoDetourManager
        // MonoDetour.HookGen.DefaultMonoDetourManager.Instance by default.
        // Use it for managing your hooks.
        On.SomeNamespace.SomeType.SomeMethod.Prefix(Prefix_SomeMethod);
    }

    private static void Prefix_SomeMethod(SomeType self, ref int number)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from Prefix hook!");
    }
}
```

MonoDetour entirely relies on `ILHook`s for hooking similar to HarmonyX. But instead of having monolithic `ILHook` methods like in HarmonyX, MonoDetour maps every hook to a unique `ILHook`.

MonoDetour achieves this by creating a small framework for ILHook wrappers, which it then uses to implement 3 basic detour types.
